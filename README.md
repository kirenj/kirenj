<h1>Hi, I'm Kiren! </h1>
I am a seasoned Mechanical Engineer with over 10 years of experience in the Construction/Oil & Gas Industry. My focus has always been on maintaining a robust security posture to safeguard sensitive information and mitigate risks, aligning my work with a strong commitment to legal compliance. While managing my time efficiently based on task priorities, I've developed a keen interest in information security and its potential to positively impact organizations.
<br/><br/>
My enthusiasm for cybersecurity stems from its ever-evolving nature, prompting me to dedicate substantial free time to continuous learning and staying updated on industry trends. In pursuit of a career transition, I have proactively learned Python and applied this knowledge to practical projects. These hands-on experiences not only demonstrate my commitment to self-improvement but also showcase my ability to apply newfound skills effectively.
<br/><br/>
I am now seeking an entry-level Python developer/ cybersecurity position where my strengths, values, and practical skills can contribute to an organization's security goals. I am confident that my unique blend of engineering expertise, security mindset, and dedication to ongoing learning make me a valuable asset in this dynamic field."
