<h1>Hi, I'm Kiren! </h1>
I'm a Mechanical Engineer who has worked for 10+ years in the Construction / Oil & Gas Industry. I am enthusiastic about information security and enjoy finding solutions to security problems that can positively impact an organization and the people it serves. I places a high value on maintaining a strong security posture to help protect sensitive information and mitigate risk. I also makes sure to manage my time according to the tasks that needs completion based on their priorities. I also adhere to the value of law when doing my tasks and make sure there is no violation of the law in my work.

The field of Cybersecurity has always intrigued me due to its nature of constant evolution as what you practice now won‚Äôt be the norm tomorrow. Hence, I dedicate a lot of my free time to learning and updating myself. I believe my strengths and values mentioned above would greatly support the security goals of any organization in which I would myself working in. As part of my desire to switch careers, I am looking for an entry-level cybersecurity position that will utilize my drive and thirst for knowledge.
